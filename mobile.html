              While in New York, I was employed in the Charivari Boutique where
              president of the company, Barbara Weiser, noticed my potential and
              passion for unique fashion and helped me launch my first fashion
              collection. My passion for African fashion is profound.
              “Everything begins for me with the print and fabric, which usually
              has some shine,” exclaims Faturoti. My deep African roots, as well
              as extensive global experience with having lived and worked in New
              York and Milan have been instrumental in her success and
              international spotlight.
            </p>
            <p>
              My pieces are also sold globally in the UK, US, and France.
              Anthony uses his talent to make an impact on the community through
              a mentoring program he runs that helps young and upcoming Nigerian
              designers excel and compete on a global platform. Nature, colors,
              and artwork are his main sources of inspiration.
